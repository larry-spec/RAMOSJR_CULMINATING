    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
         <p>Hi, I'm Larry C. Ramos Jr., currently studying programming at EDSCI. I'm passionate about daily devotion, worship, and being active in my church community. Outside of academics, I enjoy playing badminton and exploring online games.Throughout my outside journey, I have consistently demonstrated excellence and dedication to learning. I was honored to be included on the bronze seal bearer for the 2024-2025 academic year at the Escuela de Sophia of Caloocan Inc., maintaining a GPA of 94.20 and ranking among the top 12 of my class. This recognition reflects my commitment to personal and intellectual growth. In addition to my academic performance, I was also honored as the model student awardee throughout the year. Lastly, my passion for mobile games also led to the top 1 global ranking of my favorite main hero “Lesley” in the July 2021, These accomplishments underscore my drive to excel not only in the classroom but also in broader academic and creative endeavors.</p>
